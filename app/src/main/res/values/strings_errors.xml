        Colours, although pretty, currently doesn\'t show the time. Due to font restrictions and a few other details, we decided
        it was best to put it aside and work on other aspects of the collection. If you\'re alright with no time being shown, feel free
        to install it.\n\nColours does not work on non-Pebble Time devices for obvious reasons.
